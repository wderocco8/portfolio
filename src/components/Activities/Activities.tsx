          I started rock climbing about 2 years ago, and since then, it has been

          I love the challenge of finding the optimal "beta" through a problem,

          I joined PCT (a professional business fraternity) my very first

          Growing up, I always had the opportunity to watch my mom cook, and

          ended up taking more responsibility for cooking meals for the whole
          family.
