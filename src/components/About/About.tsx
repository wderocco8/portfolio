        Hello there, my name is Will, and I'm originally from Manhattan,
        although I have lived in a few other cities, my family has found our way
        back there yet again! Currently, I'm a senior and aspiring software
        engineer studying at Boston University.
      </p>
      <p>
        I absolutely love learning new skills and challenging myself in
        different respects. To learn more about what I've been working on, feel
